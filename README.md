# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes Classifier
This repository contains two notebooks with workings on two classification models.

## Title
Supervised Learning - Classification Models

## Project Description
### 1. K Nearest Neighbors
The sinking of the Titanic remains to be one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. It resulted to the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers. This project makes use of the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts which of the passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic shipwreck. The main model used is the KNN classifier where different techniques have been employed to improve the performance of the model. 

### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
Using the spambase dataset, this project makes use of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier to predict which messages are spam and which messages are not spam based on frequecy of certain words, characters and capitalization of letters. In an attempt to improve model performance, tecnhiques such as upsampling and dropping correlated features have been employed. The Support Vector Machines has also been used to compare how the two models will perform on the data.
