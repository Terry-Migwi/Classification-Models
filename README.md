# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes Classifier
This repository contains two notebooks with workings on two classification models.

## Title
Supervised Learning - Classification Models

## Author
Terry Migwi

## Project Description
### 1. K Nearest Neighbors
This project makes use of the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts which of the passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic shipwreck. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed on the variables and a prediction of persons who survived vs persons who did not survive has been performed using K-Nearest Neighbors classifier where different techniques such as finding the optimal number of K and changing the distance metrics have been employed to improve the performance of the model. 

### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
Using the spambase dataset, this project makes use of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier to predict which messages are spam and which messages are not spam based on frequecy of certain words, characters and capitalization of letters. In an attempt to improve model performance, techniques such as upsampling and dropping correlated features have been employed. The Support Vector Machines has also been used to compare which of the models performed best on this dataset.
